## Task 1: Grade Calculator
### Description:
Create a VBA program that calculates and displays the grades for a list of students based on their marks. The program should read the marks of each student from a specified range of cells in an Excel worksheet, calculate their grades according to the following grading scale, and then display the grades in an adjacent column.

***Grading Scale:***
90 or above: A
80 - 89: B
70 - 79: C
60 - 69: D
Below 60: F
***Requirements:***
- The program should prompt the user to select the range of cells containing the students' marks.
- For each student, the program should calculate the grade based on the grading scale provided above.
- The calculated grades should be displayed in an adjacent column next to the marks.
- The program should handle errors gracefully, such as non-numeric input or invalid ranges.
- Provide comments to explain the purpose of each section of your code.
### Example:
- Suppose the student marks are stored in cells A2:A10, and you run the program. After execution, the calculated grades should be displayed in cells B2:B10.

### Additional Challenge:
- Implement error handling to notify the user if any of the input marks are invalid (e.g., negative marks or marks greater than 100).

### Resources:
- VBA programming knowledge.
- Understanding of Excel worksheets and ranges.
- Students can utilize their understanding of variables, loops, conditional statements, and Excel manipulation in VBA to accomplish this task. 
- This task will help reinforce their VBA skills while also practicing problem-solving and logical thinking. Additionally, it provides an opportunity to work with real-world data processing tasks, which can be valuable in various fields.
