# Variables
In VBA (Visual Basic for Applications), a variable is a named storage location that holds data that can be manipulated or referenced within a program. Variables allow you to store and manipulate data dynamically during the execution of your code. Here are some key points to understand about variables in VBA:

### Declaration:
In VBA, you must declare variables before using them. Variable declaration specifies the data type of the variable and optionally assigns an initial value. The syntax for declaring variables is:

```vb

Dim variableName As DataType
```
1. ***Dim:*** Keyword used to declare a variable.
2. ***variableName:*** Name of the variable.
4. ***DataType:*** Type of data the variable can hold (e.g., Integer, String, Double, Boolean, etc.).
### Initialization:
Variables can be initialized with an initial value at the time of declaration or later in the code. Initialization assigns an initial value to the variable. 
### For example:

```vb

Dim age As Integer
age = 25
```
or

```vb

Dim name As String
name = "John"
```
### Data Types:
VBA supports various data types for variables. Some common data types include:

- ***Integer:*** Whole numbers between -32,768 and 32,767.
- ***Long:*** Whole numbers between -2,147,483,648 and 2,147,483,647.
- ***Double:*** Double-precision floating-point numbers.
- ***String:*** Text data.
- ***Boolean:*** True or False values.
- ***Date:*** Date values.
- ***Object:*** Reference to an object.
### Scope:
The scope of a variable refers to where in the program it can be accessed. There are two main types of variable scope in VBA:

- Procedure-level scope: Variables declared within a procedure (e.g., a Sub or Function) are accessible only within that procedure.
- Module-level scope: Variables declared outside of any procedures at the module level are accessible to all procedures within that module.
Lifetime:
- The lifetime of a variable refers to the duration for which the variable exists in memory. In VBA, variables have a lifetime corresponding to their scope:

- Procedure-level variables exist only during the execution of the procedure in which they are declared.
- Module-level variables exist as long as the module containing them is loaded into memory (i.e., as long as the workbook containing the module is open).
### Example:
```vb

Sub Example()
    Dim age As Integer ' Declaration
    age = 25 ' Initialization
    MsgBox "Age: " & age ' Displaying the value of the variable
End Sub
```
In this example, age is a variable of type Integer. It is declared and initialized with the value 25, and then a message box is displayed showing the value of the variable.

Understanding variables is fundamental in VBA programming, as they are essential for storing and manipulating data within your code.

# If statements

The If statement in VBA is used to make decisions based on conditions. It allows you to execute a block of code if a specified condition is true. If the condition is not true, you can optionally execute a different block of code using an Else statement, and you can further refine the conditions with ElseIf statements.

Here's the basic syntax of an If statement:

```VB
If condition Then
    ' code to execute if condition is true
Else
    ' code to execute if condition is false
End If
```

- condition is an expression that evaluates to either True or False.
- If condition evaluates to True, the code block following Then is executed.
- If condition evaluates to False, the code block following Else is executed (if an Else block is provided).
- The Else block is optional.

You can also have multiple conditions using ElseIf:
```VB
If condition1 Then
    ' code to execute if condition1 is true
ElseIf condition2 Then
    ' code to execute if condition2 is true
Else
    ' code to execute if none of the conditions are true
End If
```
Here's an example of an If statement in a subroutine:

```VB
Sub ExampleIfStatement()
    Dim x As Integer
    x = 10
    
    If x > 5 Then
        MsgBox "x is greater than 5"
    Else
        MsgBox "x is not greater than 5"
    End If
End Sub
```
We can modify the code to prompt the user to enter the value of x using an InputBox. 
```vb
Sub ExampleIfStatementWithInput()
    Dim x As Integer
    
    ' Prompt the user to enter the value of x
    x = InputBox("Enter the value of x:")
    
    If x > 5 Then
        MsgBox "x is greater than 5"
    Else
        MsgBox "x is not greater than 5"
    End If
End Sub
```
## Important Note:
- Ensure that the necessary Excel references are enabled in your VBA environment. 
- Go to Tools > References and check "Microsoft Excel XX.X Object Library."
- Handle errors appropriately when using WorksheetFunction as it can throw errors if the input data is not valid for the function.


## Selection Object
If you want to modify the code to get the value from a selected cell instead of a hardcoded range, you can use the Selection object to reference the currently selected cell. Here's how you can modify the code to achieve that:
```vb
Private Sub CommandButton4_Click()
    Dim x As Integer
    Dim selectedCell As Range
    
    ' Get the currently selected cell
    Set selectedCell = Selection
    x = selectedCell.Value
    
    If x > 5 Then
        MsgBox "x is greater than 5"
    Else
        MsgBox "x is not greater than 5"
    End If
End Sub
```

## Output in adjacent cell
```vb
Private Sub CommandButton4_Click()
    Dim x As Integer
    Dim selectedCell As Range
     Dim outputCell As Range
    ' Get the currently selected cell
    Set selectedCell = Selection
    x = selectedCell.Value
    ' Set the output cell to the cell next to the selected cell
    Set outputCell = selectedCell.Offset(0, 1)
    
    ' Check if the value is greater than 5
    If x > 5 Then
        outputCell.Value = "x is greater than 5"
    Else
        outputCell.Value = "x is not greater than 5"
    End If
End Sub

```
This code will take the value of the currently selected cell, perform any necessary Excel functions on it, and then print the result in the cell adjacent to the selected cell. Make sure that only one cell is selected when running this code, as it expects a single cell selection. If multiple cells are selected, it will display a message box and exit the subroutine.

# Loops

Loops in VBA allow you to repeat a block of code multiple times. There are mainly two types of loops in VBA: For loops and Do loops. Let's discuss both types:

### 1. For Loops:
For...Next Loop:
The For...Next loop is used when you know the number of times you want to execute a block of code. Here's the syntax:
```vb
For counter = start To end [Step step]
    ' Code block to be repeated
Next [counter]
```
- counter: The loop variable that is incremented with each iteration.
- start: The initial value of the loop variable.
- end: The final value of the loop variable.
- step: (Optional) Specifies how much the loop variable is incremented or decremented each time through the loop. If omitted, the default value is 1.
### Example:
```vb
Sub ForLoopExample()
    Dim i As Integer
    
    For i = 1 To 5
        MsgBox "Value of i is: " & i
    Next i
End Sub
```

## 2. Do Loops:
Do...Loop While Loop:
The Do...Loop While loop repeats a block of code while a condition is True. 
Here's the syntax:
```vb
Do
    ' Code block to be repeated
Loop While condition
```
- **condition:** The condition that determines whether to continue the loop. The loop will continue executing as long as this condition evaluates to True.
```vb
Sub DoWhileLoopExample()
    Dim i As Integer
    i = 1
    
    Do
        MsgBox "Value of i is: " & i
        i = i + 1
    Loop While i <= 5
End Sub
```
Do...Loop Until Loop:
The Do...Loop Until loop repeats a block of code until a condition becomes True. 
Here's the syntax:

```vb
Do
    ' Code block to be repeated
Loop Until condition

```
- condition: The condition that determines whether to continue the loop. The loop will continue executing until this condition becomes True.
```vb
Sub DoUntilLoopExample()
    Dim i As Integer
    i = 1
    
    Do
        MsgBox "Value of i is: " & i
        i = i + 1
    Loop Until i > 5
End Sub
```
These are the basic types of loops in VBA. They provide you with the flexibility to execute repetitive tasks efficiently. You can choose the loop type based on your specific requirements and conditions.
