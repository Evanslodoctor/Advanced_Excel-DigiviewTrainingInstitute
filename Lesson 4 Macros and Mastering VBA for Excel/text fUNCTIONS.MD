# Explanation of VBA Code

## Purpose:
The purpose of this VBA code is to convert the text in each cell of a user-selected range to uppercase.

## Code Explanation:

```vba
Private Sub CommandButton1_Click()
```
This line defines a subroutine named CommandButton1_Click, which is executed when the user clicks on a command button.

```vba

Dim selectedRange As Range
Dim cell As Range
```
These lines declare two variables: selectedRange to store the range of cells selected by the user and cell to represent each cell in the selected range during iteration.

```vba

' Prompt the user to select a range of cells
On Error Resume Next
Set selectedRange = Selection
```
Here, an input box is displayed to prompt the user to select a range of cells. Selection represents the currently selected range. The On Error Resume Next statement is used to handle cases where the user cancels the selection without choosing a range.

```vba

' Check if a range was selected
If Not selectedRange Is Nothing Then
```
This conditional statement checks if a range was successfully selected by the user.

```vba

' Loop through each cell in the selected range
For Each cell In selectedRange
```
If a range was selected, this loop iterates through each cell in the selected range.

```vba

' Check if the cell contains text
If cell.Value <> "" Then
```
Within the loop, this conditional statement checks if the cell contains any text (i.e., it's not empty).

```vba

' Convert the text in the cell to uppercase
cell.Value = UCase(cell.Value)
```
If the cell contains text, the text is converted to uppercase using the UCase function and assigned back to the cell's value.

```vba

Else
MsgBox "No range selected!", vbExclamation
End If
```
If no range was selected, a message box is displayed informing the user that no range was selected.



```VB
Private Sub CommandButton1_Click()
    
Dim selectedRange As Range
    Dim cell As Range
    
    ' Prompt the user to select a range of cells
    On Error Resume Next
    Set selectedRange = Selection
    
    
    ' Check if a range was selected
    If Not selectedRange Is Nothing Then
        ' Loop through each cell in the selected range
        For Each cell In selectedRange
            ' Check if the cell contains text
            If cell.Value <> "" Then
                ' Convert the text in the cell to lowercase
                cell.Value = UCase(cell.Value)
            End If
        Next cell
    Else
        MsgBox "No range selected!", vbExclamation
    End If
End Sub
