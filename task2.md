# Objective:
The objective of this exercise is to practice using various text functions in Excel to manipulate and analyze text data.

# Dataset:
You are provided with a dataset containing text strings ***Learn Excell Dataset***. Use this dataset to perform the tasks outlined below.

# Tasks:
Remove Extra Characters:

- Use the CLEAN function to remove all non-printable characters from the text strings.
- Apply the TRIM function to remove duplicate spaces and spaces at the start and end of each text string.
# Convert Between Upper & Lower Case:

C- onvert all text strings to lower case using the LOWER function.
- Convert all text strings to upper case using the UPPER function.
- Convert all text strings to proper case using the PROPER function.
# Convert Excel Data Types:

- Use the DOLLAR function to convert a specified number into text, using a currency format.
- Apply the TEXT function to convert the current date into text format using the format "dd-mm-yyyy".
# Converting Between Characters & Numeric Codes:

- Use the CHAR function to return the character that corresponds to a supplied numeric value.
- Apply the CODE function to return the numeric code for the first character of each text string.
# Cutting Up & Piecing Together Text Strings:

- Use the LEFT function to extract the first 3 characters from each text string.
- Apply the RIGHT function to extract the last 4 characters from each text string.
- Use the MID function to extract characters from the middle of each text string, starting at the 4th position and extracting 5 characters.
# Information Functions:

- Use the LEN function to determine the length of each text string.
- Apply the FIND function to find the position of the letter "e" within each text string.
- Use the SEARCH function to find the position of the word "Excel" within each text string.
# Replacing / Substituting Parts of a Text String:

- Use the REPLACE function to replace the first occurrence of the letter "l" with "X" in each text string.
- Apply the SUBSTITUTE function to replace all occurrences of the letter "a" with "o" in each text string.
# Additional Tasks (Optional):

- Explore other text functions not covered in the main tasks and apply them to the dataset.
- Create your own text manipulation tasks and solve them using appropriate Excel text functions.
# Instructions:
- Create a new Excel workbook or use the provided dataset.
- Perform each task using the specified text function and record the results in separate columns or worksheets.
- Ensure to document your steps and provide explanations for each task.
- Validate your results to ensure accuracy.
- Feel free to experiment with different variations of the tasks or create additional tasks for extra practice.
# Conclusion:
This exercise will help you become familiar with various text functions in Excel and enhance your skills in manipulating and analyzing text data. Experiment with different functions and explore their applications in real-world scenarios.
